 * The Plot component is the container for plots. It collects the marks with

 *
 * The Plot component is split into two parts. This is the outer Plot which
 * provides convenient defaults and automatically adds axes etc to the grapihcs.
 * The downside is that it adds a bunch of imports that you may not be using.
 * To help with this you can use the core/Plot component directly for a more
 * low-level Plot wrapper.
